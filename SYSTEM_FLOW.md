    val midterm: Double? = null,
    val final: Double? = null,
    val finalAverage: Double? = null,
    val status: GradeStatus = GradeStatus.INCOMPLETE
)

enum class GradeStatus {
    INCOMPLETE,
    PASSING,
    AT_RISK,
    FAILING
}

fun calculateFinalAverage(prelim: Double?, midterm: Double?, final: Double?): Double? {
    return if (prelim != null && midterm != null && final != null) {
        (prelim * 0.3) + (midterm * 0.3) + (final * 0.4)
    } else null
}

fun determineGradeStatus(finalAverage: Double?): GradeStatus {
    return when {
        finalAverage == null -> GradeStatus.INCOMPLETE
        finalAverage >= 75.0 -> GradeStatus.PASSING
        finalAverage >= 60.0 -> GradeStatus.AT_RISK
        else -> GradeStatus.FAILING
    }
}
```

    val gradeType: String, // PRELIM, MIDTERM, FINAL
    val value: Double,
    val timestamp: Long,
    val synced: Boolean = false
)

// Sync manager for online/offline coordination
class GradeSyncManager {
    suspend fun syncPendingGrades() {
        val pendingGrades = localDatabase.getUnsyncedGrades()
        pendingGrades.forEach { grade ->
            try {
                firestore.updateGrade(grade)
                localDatabase.markAsSynced(grade.id)
            } catch (e: Exception) {
